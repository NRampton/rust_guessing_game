1: develop guessing game in Rust
2: incorporate WebAssembly
    a: Number generation and comparison remain in WebAssembly
    b: user interactions take place in JS
3: containerize it
4: put the whole thing on AWS
5: use sessions -- user has to quit the app manually, otherwise it will continue to loop
6: wasm code starts keeping stats on a session (i.e. every time you run npm start, it re-initializes the whole game, but keeps stats until you quit)
